# nanoChat
Proyecto de nanoChat para comunicarse mediante la terminal dentro de una red local.


The prgram is divided in 3 main parts: Directory, Server and Clients.

1st -> We run the Directory (java -jar Directory.jar)

2nd -> We run the Server. If they are in the same computer you can use "localhost", if they are in the same local network you will need the IP
(java -jar NanoChatServer.jar <localhost or IP>)

3rd -> We run the clients, we proceed the same way we did wth the server (java -jar NanoChatServer.jar <localhost or IP>)

Once we have everything running we just have to use the clients, where is a help comand. And we will see some updates in the Server and Directory terminal.
